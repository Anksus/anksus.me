summary: "For a long time, I've always wanted to start my blogging site. After a bit of motivation and tweaking, here I go!"

## Why?

Knowledge is more powerful when it is shared. For the longest time I felt I don't have anything special to share and the stuff I know seemed trivial. I thought, anyone can do this.

But, things that seems trivial might add some values to others and in most cases they do.

## So, what can you expect?

This blog will serve as some aggregations of my thoughts and learnings about tech and cool things that I learn on daily basis.

So, this will be a small starting point for me to share some of my findings with the hope that it adds value to others in some way. I'm totally open to feedback and corrections. If you find any corrections or questions on any of my blogs. Please feel free to comment and report.

Best,

Ankit
