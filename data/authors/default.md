**Curious mind**, **developer**, and an **otaku** with a knack for building things. I'm a 22-year-old from India and currently a senior at the **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**.
I'm a tech enthusiast and have been fascinated with software development since I was 17. Proficient in **C++, Java, and JavaScript**. My current interest is in the area of full-stack development and networking. As a child, I got introduced to custom Android ROMs. I started tweaking my Google Nexus 7 added multi-boot support using TWRP and MultiROM. It can boot three different types of ROMs. My current laptop is dual-booted with Kali Linux and Windows 10. These tweaking and customization fueled me to pursue computers when I grew up.

Apart from cool tech stuff, I love watching anime. I have a great desire to make movies as Makoto Shinkai produces. I sketch anime characters in my free time. Petrolhead by passion.
