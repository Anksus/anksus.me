**Curious mind**, **developer** and an **otaku** with a knack for building things. I'm an 21-year-old from India and currently in a senior year at **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**.

I'm a tech enthusiast and have been fascinated with software development since I was 17. Proficient in **C++**, **Java** and **JavaScript**. My current interest are in the area of full-stack development and networking. As a child, I got introduced to custom Android ROMs. I started tweaking my Google Nexus 7, added multi-boot support using TWRP and MultiROM. It can boot three different types of ROMs. My current laptop is dual booted with Kali Linux and Windows 10. These tweaking and customization fueled me up to pursue computers when I grow up.

Apart from cool tech stuff, I love watching anime. I have a great desire to make movies as Makoto Shinkai produces. I sketch anime characters in my free time. I get way too excited about supercars. I've attended a lot of supercar rallies. This year I went to Valley Run 2021.

I strive to bring energy, technical knowledge, and a strong desire to learn with me wherever I go.
